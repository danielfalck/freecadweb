==========

mixing it up with FreeCAD, WebGL, javascript, and html

This is mostly just a spot for keeping track of my hacking attempts and maybe inspire others. I would like to create some simple tools for web pages that allow me to drop in CAD like features for 'family of parts' type functionality. Eventually I would like to use the knowledge gained here for my own small business as a means to show my customers potential parts or product. Right now I am just really really into open source cad and it's potential.
Initially, I am just setting up simple examples, using python tornado and FreeCAD.
